Gone are the days of solely relying on physical memorials like headstones, museums, and signs. They seem less immediate, formal and slow.  Online memorials on dedicated websites, Facebook pages, and even comment sections of online newspapers have become commonplace, offering immediacy and interaction that physical memorials lack. They offer new avenues for grieving loved ones to share memories, connect with others, and create an online memorial community. \r<br>\r<br>The rise of digital memorialization and commemoration platforms presents new challenges.  The impermanence of digital data, the ever-evolving nature of social media algorithms, and the ethical considerations of online privacy raise questions about the long-term viability and accessibility of digital memorials. Ownership and copyright of memorials and dedications is a sensitive topic not clearly addressed by existing norms.  Artificial intelligence tools can create interactive digital duplicates of the dead, leading family and friends into uncharted emotional and legal territory.\r<br>Alongside the challenges lie exciting possibilities. Immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are pushing the boundaries of digital remembrance, offering users the potential to experience interactive memorials and engage with the past in entirely new ways.  Some new technologies are incremental \u2013 e.g. making cemetery navigation simpler \u2013 while others are revolutionary \u2013 e.g. immersive and interactive VR tours of historical sites and communities.\r<br>\r<br>This one-day conference invites scholars, researchers, and industrial practitioners to explore the potential and challenges of current and future digital remembrance.\r<br>\r<br>Topics include, but are not limited to:\r<br>\u2022\tEvolving practices of commemorating family and friends on social media platforms.\r<br>\u2022\tDigital memorial design\r<br>\u2022\tEnabling technologies for digital memorials\r<br>\u2022\tVirtual and augmented reality experiences for remembrance in the context of family and friends.\r<br>\u2022\tEthical considerations and challenges in digital commemoration, particularly on social media.\r<br>\u2022\tThe impact of digital technologies on personal and collective memory.\r<br>\u2022\tThe role of digital preservation in safeguarding memories and history.\r<br>\u2022\tThe intersection of digital remembrance, cultural heritage, and family history.\r<br>\u2022\tEmerging technologies and their potential for future remembrance practices within families and communities.\r<br>\u2022\tSocial and cultural analyses of digital commemoration\r<br>\r<br>Submission Guidelines:\r<br>\r<br>Abstracts should be 250-300 words in English.

It has also become a growing research area that offers greater security and convenience solutions for various applications in biometrics.\r<br>\r<br>The advances in artificial intelligence, in particular in artificial learning, have allowed to resolve various complex problems related to recognition, detection, control, security, forensic identification, etc. Indeed, most of biometric technologies are based on a typical representation, including biometric data processing, feature extraction, and classification process. Deep learning offers an end-to-end learning paradigm allowing to unify these parts. It has been shown to be a promising and powerful alternative to conventional approaches based on machine learning.\r<br>\r<br>This special session aims to bring together researchers, scientists and industry professionals to present and discuss their recent contributions in deep learning for biometrics and its applications.\r<br>Topics\r<br>\r<br>The main topics that are of interest to this special session include, but are not limited to, the following:\r<br>\r<br>- Deep learning for biometrics authentication and identification\r<br>- Physiological and behavioral biometrics for recognition and security (e.g., fingerprint, palmprint, palm vein, face, iris, ear, gait, voice, etc.)\r<br>- Soft biometrics\r<br>- Multimodal biometrics\r<br>- Big Data challenges in biometrics\r<br>- Attacks on biometric systems\r<br>- Security and privacy in biometrics\r<br>- Forensic identification\r<br>- Emerging biometrics\r<br>- Related applications\r<br>\r<br>--------------------------------------------\r<br>Organizers:\r<br>\r<br>Larbi Boubchir (LIASD \u2013 University of Paris 8, France)\r<br>Boubaker Daachi (LIASD \u2013 University of Paris 8, France) \r<br>--------------------------------------------\r<br>\r<br>You can find instructions and the link to the submission form here:\r<br>\r<br>https://iconip2024.org/call-for-papers/\n\t</div>"},

We expect these submissions to describe the same quality of work as archival submissions. These will be reviewed following the same procedure as archival submissions. This option accommodates publication of the work or a superset at a later date in a conference or journal which does not allow previously archived work and to encourage presentation and feedback on mature, yet unpublished work.

EMNLP2024 has a goal of a diverse technical program\u2014in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.\r<br>\r<br>EMNLP 2024 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:\r<br>\r<br>- Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics\r<br>- Dialogue and Interactive Systems\r<br>- Discourse and Pragmatics\r<br>- Low-resource Methods for NLP\r<br>- Ethics, Bias, and Fairness\r<br>- Generation\r<br>- Information Extraction\r<br>- Information Retrieval and Text Mining\r<br>- Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP\r<br>- Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics\r<br>- Machine Learning for NLP\r<br>- Machine Translation\r<br>- Multilinguality and Language Diversity\r<br>- Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond\r<br>- Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation\r<br>- Question Answering\r<br>- Resources and Evaluation\r<br>- Semantics: Lexical, Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas\r<br>- Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining\r<br>- Speech processing and spoken language understanding\r<br>- Summarization\r<br>- Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing\r<br>- NLP Applications\r<br>- Special Theme: Efficiency in Model Algorithms, Training, and Inference\n\t</div>"},
