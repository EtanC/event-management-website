Its ultimate consequences are yet to be discovered, but the immediate effects are already visible, especially in combination with other technologies: from assistants linked to e-commerce platforms to home control systems, all the way to our workplace, especially in creative industries, there seem to be many possible applications. At the same time, in several instances, outcomes of AI systems have already led to harm, such as discrimination or fake news. If we do not want the providers of AI systems to generate our future on their own, we will need a broad societal effort to decide how to deal with this technology. Policymakers and data protection authorities have already clarified that, e.g., before using generative AI, it must comply with privacy and data protection rules. Identity management, security, and confidentiality are also pivotal for developing safe AI. The  . Nonetheless, this year, we emphasize the interplay between novel AI applications—with a focus on generative AI—and privacy and identity management. The advent of generative AI technologies has led to many privacy concerns and ethical dilemmas, highlighted by recent high-profile cases, as, quite often, providers of AI services operate globally while disregarding local privacy regulations and ethical considerations. Key issues of these services include using personal data, initially collected for other purposes, to train machine-learning models, and the indiscriminate web scraping by AI tools, potentially capturing personal data in violation of data protection rules, e.g., without consent. A particularly concerning aspect is the unintentional leakage of the personal data used in the training phase by these AI models, such as replicating a training subject’s face with a synthetic face generation tool. Another critical issue is the transparency regarding the fate of data input into AI tools (‘prompts’), often leading to unauthorized use or enhancement of subsequent AI tool versions, affecting the personal data entered in those queries. Moreover, the tendency of generative AI to produce false or ‘hallucinated’ information, especially when it relates to individuals, poses a significant threat to the data integrity and accuracy principle. The ease of creating fake photo and video montages, such as ‘deep fakes’, through generative AI tools, further exacerbates privacy concerns. The models underlying generative AI systems often contain racist and sexist material from the open web. Especially when used for decision-making processes, there are serious risks of discrimination and other harms for those affected by those decisions, particularly already marginalized people. These are exacerbated when automated decisions are involved. Current models also lack any explainability and disregard algorithmic transparency principles. Even the software development process is not immune, with tools like Copilot influencing the privacy features of products developed, raising questions about the adherence to privacy concerns and best practices in code generation. While many of these issues predate generative AI, they are significantly amplified by its emergence. Generative AI products and services must conform to principles such as fairness, accountability, transparency, security, relevance, and non-discrimination to respect and enhance the privacy of the data subjects involved. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by the intersection of AI and privacy and to explore innovative solutions for the future that respect the rights of those concerned.  aims to create a platform for spreading awareness and facilitating interactions and knowledge exchanges around old and new issues by taking a holistic approach to society and technology. We support interdisciplinary research exchange and foster discussions through keynote lectures, tutorials, and workshops. Participants will benefit from presenting their research and receiving meaningful feedback. The IFIP Summer School culminates in the publication of selected papers by the participants as an edited volume published by Springer. We welcome contributions addressing these issues from any of the following perspectives (and especially the interdisciplinary combination of more than one): sociological, legal, technical, ethical, political, surveillance, intersectional, anthropological, economic, historical, media & communication, regulatory, philosophical, critical, disabilities, and psychological studies in the areas of privacy, data protection, and identity management. The IFIP Summer School encourages not only interdisciplinarity but also broader diversity. It particularly welcomes submissions on how to foster gender and cultural balance in privacy and identity research and policy, and notably, tutorials and workshops about how to raise awareness in these matters. The research paper presentations focus on involving students and on encouraging the publication of high-quality, thorough research papers by students and young researchers. To this end, the school will have the following process for submissions: A workshop is an interactive session scheduled for one or two hours and focuses on involving students in discussion. In it, participants jointly work on a topic or project related to the Summer School theme. Workshop activities are summarized in short papers that recapitulate the outcome and the kinds of discussion raised in the Summer School for inclusion in the proceedings. Proposals for workshops should contain a 2-page statement presenting the topic and summarising the planned activity and the expected contributions from the audience members, e.g., responding to a questionnaire or conducting a small experiment. Proposers should indicate whether any special equipment is needed for the workshop, such as audio-visual systems or computational equipment and support. Tutorials are one or two-hour-long presentations. They should deal with topics that interest the interdisciplinary audience in the Summer School. Tutorials should provide knowledge on theoretical, empirical, methodological, practical, or other aspects relevant to the Summer School. Tutorial Proposals should contain a 2-page summary and state the level and background required for audience members to follow the tutorial.

The book series discusses daring and prospective approaches, and serves as an insightful resource for readers with an interest in computers, privacy and data protection.The working title of this new volume is ' '. Contributors are invited to submit an academic contribution to the book that will also publish the best papers that were presented in the Academic paper track. Authors who have already submitted to the CPDP Conference call for papers will have their papers automatically submitted for the book. All other authors are asked to submit their work here.  Our ambition is to have the seventeenth book ready and available before the next CPDP conference – i.e., May 2025 – which means that the review process will take place in the months of August and September, and that we will look to finalise the manuscript before the second week of October.All the proposed contributions will be submitted to a scientific peer review process coordinated by the editors of the volume. Editors will then feed comments back to the authors, who will then have the chance to offer their rebuttals. The reviewers will also be asked to check if authors have respected the Chicago Reference Style (see point 8 below) and the quality of English (see point 3 below).Please, let us know as soon as possible if you intend to submit a contribution. This would help us plan the further work on this volume.   If you intend to propose a contribution as an author, there are a number of important issues we want to make you aware of from the outset. 1. Only original and unpublished work, not submitted anywhere else, should be submitted to the book3 2. The total amount of royalties generated by the book will be transferred to a Privacy Salon-account and will be integrally used for the organization of the next CPDP conference. 3. Hart requires every author of a contribution to accept and sign the contributor form. Details about the procedure for submitting this form will be sent to the corresponding authors after review and acceptance of the papers. 4. Only chapters that adhere to academic standards will be accepted for the book. 5. Non-native English-speaking authors are requested to have their contributions reviewed and corrected by a native English speaker, prior to submission. In order to make the costly and intense process of language review easier, we would appreciate it if the authors would only submit contributions written in the best possible English. The peer review process will also evaluate the quality of English. 6. Contributions must be submitted in Word format (not Latex or PDF). Each contribution must use footnotes (not endnotes) numbered consecutively. Each contribution must also provide a Bibliography, listing all the sources used by the authors. Regarding numbering, the decimal system should be used: i.e. for Chapter X, each heading will be numbered X.1, X.2, X.3, etc., and each subheading X.1.1., X.1.2, X. 1.3, etc. and each subsubheading X.1.1.1., X.1.1.2, X.1.1.3. etc. 7. Contributions need to be anonymized for blind peer review. 8. Authors must make use of the Chicago Manual of Style (http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html and http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html), and more precisely the humanities style (notes N, and B bibliography) and not the author-date system.
